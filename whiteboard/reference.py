OVERVIEW = """\
A live whiteboard the user is watching in their browser. Everything you draw
appears with a marker-drawing animation, in the order you send it, so draw the
way a person would explain at a whiteboard: title first, then sections, then
details and arrows.

Coordinates: the board is 1600 x 1000 (x to the right, y down, origin top-left).
Most elements use x,y = top-left corner and w,h = size; give cx,cy instead to
centre an element on a point. Exceptions: circle with r (x,y = centre),
text/title with align "center" (x = centre line), mindmap (cx,cy = centre).
Leave out x/y and the board auto-places the element in free space, or place it
relative to another one with "below": "<id>" (also "above", "right_of",
"left_of", plus optional "gap" and "align_to": "start" | "center" | "end").
Every reply lists each element's id and bbox [x, y, w, h]: reuse ids for arrows,
updates and erasing. The robot mascot sits in the bottom-right corner
(x > 1400, y > 770) while it is shown."""

TIPS = """\
Tips
- Send related elements in one draw call; they animate one after another.
- Use auto-placement or below/right_of when unsure of free space; the board
  avoids overlaps. get_board shows an occupancy map of free cells.
- Call look after a drawing to see it the way the user does, then fix overlaps
  with update (move with x/y or dx/dy) or erase.
- Keep words short: whiteboards are for headlines, not paragraphs.
- Use say for one-line commentary from the mascot and point_at to direct the
  user's attention while you explain. To pace a presentation, give say a
  "pause" (seconds) or call pause: the board waits before drawing what comes next."""
